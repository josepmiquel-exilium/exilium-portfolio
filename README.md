## Introduction

As a full-stack developer, I have created this portfolio to provide a comprehensive overview of my projects and expertise. The portfolio is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, allowing visitors to explore my work and understand my skills.

## Features

-   **React**: The portfolio is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a robust and efficient way to create interactive components.
-   **Sass**: Sass is used for styling the portfolio. It is a powerful CSS preprocessor that enhances the maintainability and reusability of stylesheets.
-   **Sanity CMS**: Sanity CMS is the content management system used to manage the portfolio's content. It provides an intuitive interface for editing and organizing project information.
